# Habit-Tracker

Cli app I made in order to trains my SQLite database handling and other stuff

The point of it was to train OOP, how to structure the projects the right way and think ahead. Split classes and functionalities in to different directories and places. 

I think I could still split datamanipulation section a bit more and better and atomize all of the function in to even smaller parts of the whole app.

I'm not really produ of ExecuteSql method being this big and all mighty but on the end of the day it works
